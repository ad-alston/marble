# marble
A persistent language.

marble is an open-source language whose goal is to implement a persistent object-oriented model of programming.  Many popular languages (like Java or Python) implement a traditional object-oriented model in which object representation and operations are found in memory.  marble combines this model with the idea of an object-relational mapper (ORM) with the aim of doing the same thing in persistent disk space.
